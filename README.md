# Data-Analysis

In this project, I aimed to predict the age of abalones based on physical attributes like shell size and weight. Using R 🖥️, Tidyverse 📊, and ggplot2 📉, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) 🔍, and built regression models to predict the target variable (age). Key insights were visualized, revealing significant patterns in the data. The outcome was a predictive model that effectively estimates abalone age, supported by clear and impactful visualizations.
