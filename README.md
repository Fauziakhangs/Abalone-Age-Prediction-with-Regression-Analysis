# Data-Analysis & Regression

**📌 Overview**

In this project, I aimed to predict the age of abalones based on physical attributes like shell size and weight. Using R 🖥️, Tidyverse 📊, and ggplot2 📉, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) 🔍, and built regression models to predict the target variable (age). Key insights were visualized, revealing significant patterns in the data. The outcome was a predictive model that effectively estimates abalone age, supported by clear and impactful visualizations.

**🧠 My Approach**

I used real-world data about abalones, like their weight, size, and even whether they were male, female, or young. I also looked at how these features were connected to their age. Some measurements didn’t follow a clear pattern, so I transformed the data to make it easier to work with. Then, I built a model that could learn from the data and make age predictions without needing a microscope.

**🛠️ Tools & Techniques**

I used a software tool called R, which helps analyze data and create models. I tested different ways of preparing the data and picked the method that gave the best results. To check how well my model was doing, I used a process called cross-validation, which helps make sure the predictions are reliable even on new data.

**📈 Outcome**

In the end, my model could correctly explain more than 60% of the differences in abalone ages, which is a strong result for this kind of data. This model can help researchers and fishery managers estimate the age of abalones much more quickly, leading to better protection of this species and smarter fishing decisions.
